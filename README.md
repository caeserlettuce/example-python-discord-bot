 learning the new ways of discord bot via python instead of node js


previously in my life, i have made (i think) all of my discord bots in node js. NO LONGER!!! i am going to learn the dark art of python discord bot. because i am way more familiar with python now. i don't even remember the last time i tried coding a discord bot


## library

"what library will you be using??"

good question. `discord.py`.

why? because it was the first result on google, and the github was last updated 6 hours ago.


## stuff

"where is config.json????"

nice try. you're not getting my bot token THAT easily.

`config.json` is set up like this:

```json
{
    "clientId": "client id goes here",
    "token": "token goes here"
}
```

so yeah. thats it
